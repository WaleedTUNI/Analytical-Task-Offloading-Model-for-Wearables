Summary:
The development of small form-factor handheld electronics is pacing the personal devices market, followed by the increasing number of various applications. Some of those applications also cover computation-hungry use-cases, such as image or video processing and compression, among others. Historically, wearable and handheld devices were not designed to execute computationally intensive operations for reasons ranging from limited battery capacity to the radiated heat. Offloading computationally heavy tasks to a comparatively more powerful and less energy-dependent device can help prolong the battery lifetime of a wearable. This paper analyzes different task offloading scenarios from the wearable to a device located at the network edge. Such a device can be a smartphone paired with the wearable or an edge server co-located with the cellular base station. A comprehensive performance evaluation conducted under a wide variety of realistic settings in terms of task demands, processing capabilities, and data rate, unveils the circumstances in which offloading is convenient and when it is not, in terms of meaningful metrics.
The main contributions provided in this paper are:
1.	We study a two-tier edge architecture for task offloading from wearables to the edge, which encompasses a smartphone and an edge server as candidate task executors. 
2.	We analyze the performance of task execution at wearable devices by identifying the limits.
3.	We explain to which extent and under which circumstances task offloading to the edge may bring improvements. To this aim, we analyze two meaningful metrics, i.e., task accomplishment time and energy consumption due to mobile devices' computing and communication procedures involved in the task offloading (i.e., wearable and smartphone). Such analysis is provided through a comprehensive and flexible analytical playground under a large variety of realistic settings regarding computing task requirements, device capabilities, and the distance between involved devices.
